# Machine Learning with TensorFlow sample code

This repo includes the Python code from the simple classification exercise from the TensorFlow website.
The code is enhanced slightly to save the model to a folder so that the trained model can then be loaded into a C# application for use with predictions without having to retrain the model in C#.
